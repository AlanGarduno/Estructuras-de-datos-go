/*
This code is an example of algoritm called insertion sort
this algorim checks item by item if the (left one elements) is minor than the actual item till actual item is the 
minor one.
Basic-Algoritm-Exaple
Supose tha we have the array [10,4,1] **This array is already sorted but we will resorted by minor to major
The first element is 10 and on the left there´s nothig, so the algoritm will assume that this one is sorted
Then the next one item 4, it has the 10 on its left so the algoritm will swap this items
[4,10,1]
Then the 4 is the first element
Then with 1, it has the 10 item on its left, so just like before they will swap
[4,1,10]
and repeating, beacuse 4>1
for finally
[1,4,10], and that´s it. ;)

Implemetation on go, you can also try it on C the code is so similar.
This code is for the employee/interested tests.

If you wanna see this explanation in Spanish or in ay other language you have a ref link in your mail, in fact you must be an employee or an interested
